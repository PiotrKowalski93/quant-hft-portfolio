**Value investing**
is an investment strategy where you buy stocks (or other assets) that appear undervalued compared to their intrinsic value (the true worth of the company, based on fundamentals). The goal is to invest in companies that the market is currently underpricing and hold them until the market recognizes their real value.

1) Intrinsic Value vs. Market Price
- Intrinsic value is estimated through financial analysis (earnings, cash flows, assets, growth potential).
- If a stockâ€™s market price is significantly below its intrinsic value â†’ itâ€™s considered undervalued.

2) Margin of Safety
- Value investors only buy when the discount (intrinsic value â€“ market price) is large enough.
- This provides a buffer against errors in judgment or unexpected events.

3) Long-Term Horizon
- The strategy relies on markets eventually correcting mispricings.
- It often requires patience, since the correction may take years.

4) Fundamental Analysis
- Focuses on company fundamentals:
- Financial health (balance sheet, cash flow, debt levels).

5) Earnings and growth potential.
- Competitive advantage (brand, patents, network effects).
- Management quality.

6) Contrarian Approach
- Value investors often buy when others are pessimistic and sell when others are overly optimistic.
- This means going against the market trend sometimes.
