**Value investing**
is an investment strategy where you buy stocks (or other assets) that appear undervalued compared to their intrinsic value (the true worth of the company, based on fundamentals). The goal is to invest in companies that the market is currently underpricing and hold them until the market recognizes their real value.

1) Intrinsic Value vs. Market Price
- Intrinsic value is estimated through financial analysis (earnings, cash flows, assets, growth potential).
- If a stockâ€™s market price is significantly below its intrinsic value â†’ itâ€™s considered undervalued.

2) Margin of Safety
- Value investors only buy when the discount (intrinsic value â€“ market price) is large enough.
- This provides a buffer against errors in judgment or unexpected events.

3) Long-Term Horizon
- The strategy relies on markets eventually correcting mispricings.
- It often requires patience, since the correction may take years.

4) Fundamental Analysis
- Focuses on company fundamentals:
- Financial health (balance sheet, cash flow, debt levels).

5) Earnings and growth potential.
- Competitive advantage (brand, patents, network effects).
- Management quality.

6) Contrarian Approach
- Value investors often buy when others are pessimistic and sell when others are overly optimistic.
- This means going against the market trend sometimes.

ðŸ“Š Common Metrics in Value Investing:
- P/E ratio (Price to Earnings) â†’ low compared to peers/industry.
- P/B ratio (Price to Book Value) â†’ low compared to companyâ€™s assets.
- Dividend yield â†’ high, sustainable dividends.
- Debt-to-equity ratio â†’ lower debt preferred.
- Free cash flow â†’ positive and stable.

# ðŸ“˜ Valuation Ratios â€“ Quick Reference

## 1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  P/E = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}
  \]  
- **Meaning**: Shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **High P/E** â†’ investors expect strong future growth.  
  - **Low P/E** â†’ possibly undervalued or company facing difficulties.  
- **Types**:  
  - **Trailing P/E** â†’ based on last 12 monthsâ€™ earnings.  
  - **Forward P/E** â†’ based on forecasted earnings.  

## 2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  P/B = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Book Value of Equity}}
  \]  
  or  
  \[
  P/B = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}
  \]  
- **Meaning**: Compares market value to net asset value on the balance sheet.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **P/B < 1** â†’ market values company below its accounting book value (possible undervaluation).  
  - **P/B > 1** â†’ investors pay a premium for expected growth, brand value, or profitability.  

## 3. **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  P/S = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Total Revenue}}
  \]  
  or  
  \[
  P/S = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Sales per Share}}
  \]  
- **Meaning**: Shows how much investors pay for each dollar of sales.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **Low P/S** â†’ may indicate undervaluation (if company has healthy margins).  
  - **High P/S** â†’ market expects strong growth or high profit margins.  

## 4. **EV/EBITDA Ratio**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  EV/EBITDA = \frac{\text{Enterprise Value (EV)}}{\text{Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization}}
  \]  
- **Meaning**: Measures how expensive a company is relative to its operating cash flow.  
- **Why EV?** â†’ EV accounts for debt and cash, making it more accurate than market cap alone.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **Low EV/EBITDA** â†’ potentially undervalued (cheaper relative to earnings).  
  - **High EV/EBITDA** â†’ investors pricing in strong growth or company is overvalued.  
- **Common Use**: Comparing companies across industries, especially with different capital structures.  

## 5. **EV/Gross Profit (EV/GP) Ratio**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  EV/GP = \frac{\text{Enterprise Value (EV)}}{\text{Gross Profit}}
  \]  
- **Meaning**: Compares company valuation to its gross profit (revenues â€“ cost of goods sold).  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **Low EV/GP** â†’ company generates a lot of gross profit relative to its valuation.  
  - **High EV/GP** â†’ market pricing in strong future growth or brand value.  
- **Why use it?** Useful when EBITDA is negative (e.g. early-stage or high-growth companies).
