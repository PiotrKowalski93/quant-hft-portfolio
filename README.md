## Theory Notes

Algorytmic trading means using computers to make investmen decisions
The process of running quantitative investing strategy can be broken down into the following steps:

a. Collect data
b. Develop a hypothesis for strategy
c. Bactest that strategy
d. Implement the strategy in production

### Backtesting 

Backtesting is a method used to assess the potential profitability and effectiveness of a trading strategy or predictive model by applying it to historical data. It's essentially a simulation that allows traders and investors to evaluate how a strategy would have performed in the past, without risking real capital. This process helps identify potential weaknesses, refine strategies, and build confidence before deploying them in live markets. 

### Momentum Investing

Momentum investing means investing in assets that have increased in price the most. 

### Value Investing

Value investing means investing in stock that are trading below their percived intrinsic value.
Creating algorythmic value investring strategies relies on a concept called **multiples**.

Multiples are calculated by divifing a company's stock price by some measure of the company's worth - like earnings or asstes.
Some examples of common multiples used in value investing:

a) Price-to-earnings
b) Price-to-book-value
c) Price-to-free-cash-flow

Each of the individual multiples used by value investors has its pros and cons.
One way to minimize the impact of any specific multiple is by using a **composite**.
